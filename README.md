## Description:
Welcome to our GraphQL server project built with Node.js and powered by the Apollo Server library. This project showcases the power and efficiency of GraphQL over traditional RESTful APIs. By leveraging Apollo Server, we establish a robust connection to seamlessly fetch data from a specified data source and deliver precise information from server to client based on requested queries. 

## Key Features:
- Built with Node.js and Apollo Server for efficient GraphQL implementation.
- Demonstrates the advantages of GraphQL in avoiding under-fetching and over-fetching of data.
- Provides a clear comparison between GraphQL and RESTful APIs.
- Offers a practical example of how GraphQL enhances data querying precision.

## Purpose:
This project aims to educate and illustrate the benefits of GraphQL by showcasing how it streamlines the process of querying data, ensuring that only the necessary information is retrieved without unnecessary data overhead. By exploring this repository, developers can gain insights into the advantages of adopting GraphQL over traditional RESTful APIs.
